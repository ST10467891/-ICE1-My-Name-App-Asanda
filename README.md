##App Setup Process
I started by creating a main folder and a subfolder using the Explorer in Visual Studio Code. Inside the project, I worked with the App.tsx file and wrote the code in TypeScript.
Next, I used Terminal 1 and the Integrated Terminal to run and monitor the app. After writing the code, I loaded the app using BlueStacks. Once everything was set up correctly, the app ran successfully and functioned as expected.
## Reflection
The most challenging part of setting up the app was getting the emulator to run properly. At first, the app would not load at all.I had to restart the emulator,open Bluestacks ,and use the command prompt to help resolve the issue. After restarting everything(including my code on Visual Studio Code) the emulator finally worked,and the app loaded successfully. Additionally, pushing my code from Visual Studio Code to GitHub came with a few errors, it was not clear at first as i followed the correct git commands. I later realised i had not opened my GitHub workflow.This experience reminded me that persistance and trying different tools can make a big difference when things don't go as expected. With that being said, it also helped me build confidence in using developer tools and taught me how to stay calm and work through issues step by step.
